PW Whitelisting Gateway Manager is an interface for managing whitelists and system services in a new type of network security device.
Built on the laravel framework, it's very easy to extend, maintain and work on. It currently supports iptables and a custom version of tinyproxy.

The interface is responsively designed for mobile devices or computers. Utilizing email and an intuitive interface, it will allow users to completely lock down their 
home/office network using the "Default Deny". What's different about PWWGM is that it will be so easy to use that my mom can use it, yet give fine grained control over 
what is allowed to enter and leave your network. Out of the box there will be access packs to allow common mainstream sites, services etc  to work with a simple checklist interface.
